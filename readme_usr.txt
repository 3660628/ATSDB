Installation
------------
For your convenience, for a number of platforms binary builds have been created, which can be downloaded from the sourceforge homepage (sourceforge.net/projects/atsdb/files/).

The following libraries are required to use the project library, in their developer versions:
* gdal (http://www.gdal.org/)
* qt4 (http://qt-project.org/)
* boost (http://www.boost.org/)
* mysql connector (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/)
* log4cpp (http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/)
* tinyxml2 (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/)

For a number of system, installation scripts have been written that, if executed as root, install the libraries. They can be found in the 'installation/' folder with the appropriate usb-folder.

* centos_6.4/install_usr.sh
* centos_6.5/install_usr.sh
* ubuntu_14.04/install_usr.sh

If you use one of these system, please execute the appropriate shell-script as root. If you are on a different platform, please use the package-manager of your choice to install the listed libraries.
